# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository explores **Requirement Analysis** as a crucial phase in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**. It covers the definition, significance, activities involved, types of requirements, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria. The content is intended for educational purposes and software project planning.
## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a new or modified software system. It serves as the foundation for successful software development by ensuring that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the systemâ€™s goals and constraints.

This process involves:
- Interacting with stakeholders such as clients, users, and developers.
- Clarifying ambiguities and conflicts in requirements.
- Defining functional and non-functional requirements.
- Establishing clear documentation to guide design, development, and testing.

Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** because it lays the groundwork for building systems that meet user needs and business goals. Without it, development may proceed in the wrong direction, leading to costly revisions and project failure.
